1.Collection is a interface used to store group of elements.Collection Interface extends Iterable interface.List,Set,Sorted Set,Queue are Interface which extends 
 collection interface.Array List,Linked List implements List Interface.Hashset,Linked Hashset implements Set.Treeset implements Sorted Set Interface.
 In List,it alllows duplicate elements.In set it doesn't allow duplicates.Set is used to store unordered elements.List contains ordered elements.
 Insertion order is maintained in list.In Set,there is no insertion order of elements.List is index based.Set is not index based.

2.In map interface,sorted map extends Map Interface.Hashmap implements Map interface.TreeMap implements sorted map.Linked hashmap extends hashmap.

3.Hash set is implemented using HashTable.The tree set is implemented using a tree structure. Hash set use equals method to compare two objects.
  Tree set use compare method for comparing two objects.HashSet does not maintain any order.TreeSet maintains an object in sorted order.HashSet allows a null object.
  The tree set does not allow the null object. It throws the null pointer exception.

4.HashMap implements the map interface. It stores the data in the pair of Key and Value.In equals method,It checks the equality of two objects.
  It compares the Key, whether they are equal or not.In hashcode,It returns the memory reference of the object in integer. 
  
5. The Fail Fast iterators immediately throw ConcurrentModificationException in case of structural modification of the collection. 
   Structural modification means adding, removing, updating the value of an element in a data collection while another thread is iterating over that collection. 
   The Fail Safe iterators are just opposite to Fail Fast iterators, A fail-safe iterator does not throw any exceptions unless it can handle if the collection
   is modified during the iteration process. This can be done because they operate on the copy of the collection object instead of the original object. The structural 
   changes performed on the original collection ignored by them and affect the copied collection, not the original collection. So, the original collection will be 
   kept structurally unchanged. 

7.Spliterators can be used for traversing the elements of a source one by one. These sources could be an array, a Collection. The main functionalities of Spliterator 
  are:-Splitting the source data,Processing the source data.

8.Joining Strings With the Stream,Splitting Strings With Stream,String Array to Map With Stream.

9.spring-core is the core of the framework that contain features such as Inversion of Control and dependency injection.

10.Dependency Injection uses concept of Inversion of Control. A Java class has a dependency on another class.There are three types of dependency injection.They are:-
 constructor injection, method injection, and property injection.

11.Bean is used to create and manage object using spring.The ComponentScan annotation is used to find beans and the corresponding injected with Autowired annotation.

13.String buffer and StringBuilder both are mutable classes which can be used to do operation on string objects such as reverse of string, concating string.String Buffer 
   is synchronized.String builder is not synchronized.String Buffer is thread-safe. So, multiple threads canâ€™t access at the same time, it is slow.
   String builder is not thread-safe hence faster than String Buffer.

14.Beanfactory instantiate beans when getBean() method gets called.Application Context instantiate bean at the time container start.

15.2.IOC:IoC Container is the core of Spring Framework. It creates the objects, configures their dependencies.
     The Container uses Dependency Injection(DI) to manage the components.
   3.POJO:POJO stands for Plain Old Java Object.They are used to create and increase the readability and reusability of our code.
   4.Component:. It is used to denote a class as a Component. We can use @Component across the class to mark the beans as Spring's managed components.  
   5.Component Scan:With Spring, we use the @ComponentScan annotation along with the @Configuration annotation to specify the packages that we want to be scanned.
   6.Bean: any object in the Spring framework that we initialize through Spring container is called Spring Bean. Any Java class can be a Spring Bean if 
           it's configured to be initialized via container by providing configuration metadata information.
